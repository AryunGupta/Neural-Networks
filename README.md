# Stock-Price-Forecasting

A machine learning model that predicts Microsoft's stock prices and then forecasts using LSTM Neural Networks. The model isn't perfect and isn't reliable for long term but works fair for short term (day to day).

Tinkering with the number of windows, learning rate, etc. all affects the accuracy of the model.

A lot of the techniques I used were taken from the machine learning projects I did in university.
